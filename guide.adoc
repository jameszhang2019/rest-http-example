= Understanding how to deploy a simple RESTful service and front-end on OpenShift using Spring Boot and Apache CXF

This document will guide you through the steps to create a simple "Hello World" RESTful web service using
http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] and https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]. The functionality is
similar to the application being developed in
https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/[Spring Boot's guide on building RESTful services]. However, where the Spring
Boot guide uses Spring-specific annotations to define the endpoint and its method, we will use standard
https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=370[JAX-RS] annotations, which make it easier to reuse endpoints implementations across
servers, should you want to target a different platform than Spring Boot at some point. Moreover, you will also
understand the steps needed to deploy your application on an OpenShift cluster.

== What you'll build

The application you will be building exposes a very simple greeting web service accepting `GET` HTTP requests to
`/api/greeting`, responding with a JSON message in the form `{"content":"Hello, World!"}`. The
message can be customized by passing the `name` query parameter to the request as in
`http://localhost:8080/api/greeting?name=John` which would result in the following response: `{"content":"Hello,
John!"}`.
Additionally, a very simple front-end is provided using HTML and jQuery to interact with the greeting endpoint
from a more user-friendly interface than query the service using https://curl.haxx.se/[`cURL`].

NOTE: While we will go over the implementation, we will focus mostly on the specifics needed to get your application running on
OpenShift as opposed to detailing all the Spring Boot-specific implementation.

== What you'll need

* Java 8
* Access to an OpenShift cluster whether locally via https://www.openshift.org/minishift/[minishift] or using the different
  flavors of https://www.openshift.com/products[OpenShift products]


== Endpoint

The application is composed of a RESTful service which code can be found in the `src/main/java/io/openshift/booster/service`
directory. It is split in two classes: `GreetingEndpoint`, which is implements the endpoint itself, and `Greeting` which is a
simple class representing the payload sent back to users of the endpoint.

Let's look at the `Greeting` class first, which is pretty simple:
```java
public class Greeting {

    public static final String FORMAT = "Hello, %s!"; #<1>

    private final String content; #<2>

    public Greeting() {
        this.content = null;
    }

    public Greeting(String content) {
        this.content = content;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
```
<1> `FORMAT` constant that can be used by clients of the class to create greeting messages in the expected format
<2> `content` field which will be used to populate our JSON payload
This `Greeting` class will be automatically marshalled by Jackson using the accessor.

Let's now look at the `GreetingEndpoint` class, short and sweet but packing quite a punch, thanks to annotations:
```java
import javax.ws.rs.DefaultValue; # <1>
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.QueryParam;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Path("/greeting") # <2>
@Component # <3>
public class GreetingEndpoint {
    @GET # <4>
    @Produces("application/json") # <5>
    public Greeting greeting(@QueryParam("name") @DefaultValue("World") String name) { #<6>
        final String message = String.format(Greeting.FORMAT, name); #<7>
        return new Greeting(message); #<8>
    }
}
```
<1> Standard JAX-RS annotation imports
<2> Specify that this class is a JAX-RS root resource and that the endpoint will answer requests on `/greeting`
<3> Mark the endpoint as a Spring component to be managed by Spring Boot. In conjunction with the `cxf.jaxrs.component-scan` property set to `true` in `application.properties`, this allows CXF to create a JAX-RS endpoint from the auto-discovered JAX-RS root resources.
<4> Mark the `greeting` method as answering HTTP `GET` requests
<5> Specify that the method returns JSON content (`application/json` content type)
<6> The `name` method parameter is annotated with `@QueryParam("name")` to specify that it is passed as a query parameter in the URL when the service is invoked and that its default value is `World` if none is provided (thanks to the `@DefaultValue("World")` annotation)
<7> We format the message using the `Greeting.FORMAT` constantâ€¦
<8> and return a `Greeting` instance with the proper message. This object will be automatically serialized to JSON using https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] as we will see later.

As you can see, there isn't much to it as far as code goes.

We still need to configure CXF and Spring Boot properly for everything to work well.

On the Spring Boot side, we need an entry point to our service in the form a class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, also giving us the opportunity to further configure our stack:
```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.json.JacksonJsonProvider;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication #<1>
public class BoosterApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(BoosterApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public JacksonJsonProvider jsonProvider() { #<2>
        return new JacksonJsonProvider(); 
    }
}
```
<1> Activates auto-configuration, component scan and marks the class as providing configuration using the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-using-springbootapplication-annotation.html[`@SpringBootApplication` annotation]. This also allows to package the application as a jar that can be run as a typical application. Spring Boot will then start the embedded Tomcat server.
<2> Specifies that the JSON provider to be used by CXF (which uses http://cxf.apache.org/docs/configuration.html[Spring as basis of its configuration]) should be Jackson.

NOTE: You'll note that, contrary to https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.18.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#mvc[Spring MVC] where Jackson only needs to be present on the classpath for it to be used, Apache CXF requires Jackson to be explicitly configured. This could be done via XML but we might as well leverage the `@SpringBootApplication` configuration capability.

Let's now look at the content of `application.properties` which we need to further configure CXF:
```properties
cxf.path:/api #<1>
cxf.jaxrs.component-scan:true #<2>
```
<1> Specify that CXF will answer to requests sent to the `/api` context. Our endpoint root resource is annotated with `@Path("/greeting")` which means that the full context for our endpoint will be `/api/greeting`.
<2> As mentioned above when we looked at the `GreetingEndpoint` class, we need to set that property to `true` to activate automatic creation of endpoint based on resource detection.

== Frontend

Let's take a quick look at our frontend. It's implemented as a static HTML `src/resources/static/index.html` file served from the root of the embedded Tomcat server. The basic idea is similar to what is explained in the https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest-jquery/[onsuming a RESTful Web Service with jQuery] Spring Boot guide so we will only focus on the salient parts for our purpose.

In our case, our service is running on the same server so we don't need to worry about https://spring.io/understanding/CORS[CORS]. Moreover, for the same reason, we don't need any extra code for Spring Boot to start Tomcat. 

The simple UI consists in a form to specify which name to pass to the greeting service and then invoke it:
```html
<form class="form-inline">
    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" class="form-control" id="name" placeholder="World"> #<1>
    </div>
    <button id="invoke" type="submit" class="btn btn-success">Invoke</button> #<2>
</form>
<p class="lead">Result:</p>
<pre><code id="greeting-result">Invoke the service to see the result.</code></pre> #<3>
```
<1> Text input to enter the name to pass to the greeting service
<2> Button to trigger the call to the greeting service
<3> Placeholder text that will be replaced by the result of the service call

and the embedded jQuery script:
```js
  $(document).ready(function () {
    $("#invoke").click(function (e) { #<1>
      var n = $("#name").val() || "World"; #<2>
      $.getJSON("/api/greeting?name=" + n, function (res) { #<3>
        $("#greeting-result").text(JSON.stringify(res)); #<4>
      });
      e.preventDefault();
    });
  });
```
<1> Add a `click` even handler to the button with the `invoke` id
<2> Retrieve the value of the `name` input to pass to the greeting server
<3> Invoke the RESTful endpoint and retrieve the JSON response
<4> Replace the content of the element with the `greeting-result` id with the result of the invocation

== Building and testing the application locally

You can run the application using `./mvnw spring-boot:run`, using the `run` goal of the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.x/maven-plugin//index.html[Maven Spring Boot plugin].
It's also possible to build the JAR file with `./mvnw clean package` and run it like a traditional Java application:

    java -jar target/spring-boot-rest-http-<version>.jar

where `<version>` corresponds to the current version of the project.
Once the application is started, you can visit http://localhost:8080/index.html to see the frontend of the application and interact with the greeting service.

Let's look at the important parts of the Maven project to properly build and run the application locally.

First, we need to tell Maven that we're using Spring Boot and more specifically that we want to use the http://snowdrop.me/[Snowdrop] supported set of Spring Boot starters. This is accomplished by using 2 properties and importing the https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-bom/tree/sb-1.5.x[Snowdrop Bill Of Materials (BOM)] and any dependencies we need for our application:
```xml
...
<properties>
    <spring-boot-bom.version>1.5.14.Final</spring-boot-bom.version> #<1>
    <spring-boot.version>1.5.14.RELEASE</spring-boot.version> #<2>
    ....
</properties>
...
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>me.snowdrop</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-bom</artifactId>
        <version>${spring-boot-bom.version}</version> #<3>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
      </dependency>
      ...
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>   #<4>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>  #<5>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
        <artifactId>cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxrs</artifactId> #<6>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs</groupId>
        <artifactId>jackson-jaxrs-json-provider</artifactId> #<7>
      </dependency>
      ...
  </dependencies>
...
```
<1> Specify the BOM version we want to use. More details on the
https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-bom/tree/sb-1.5.x[BOM content] and its
https://github.com/snowdrop/spring-boot-bom/tree/sb-1.5.x#versioning-scheme[versioning scheme] are available.
<2> Associated Spring Boot version
<3> The BOM version is imported in the `dependencyManagement` section of the POM file
<4> Since the BOM defines supported versions, we can then import supported dependencies without having to worry about their respective versions
<5> Specify that we want to use Spring Boot with an embedded Tomcat server
<6> Needed to be able to use Apache CXF integration with Spring Boot
<7> Needed so that Apache CXF can use Jackson as JSON marshaller as seen above when we defined a `jsonProvider` bean provider method in our application entry point

Let's now look at the build configuration:

```xml
...
<build>
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory>src/main/resources</directory>
        <filtering>true</filtering> #<3>
      </resource>
    </resources>
    <testResources>
      <testResource>
        <directory>src/test/resources</directory>
        <filtering>true</filtering> #<4>
      </testResource>
    </testResources>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${spring-boot.version}</version> #<1>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration/>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>repackage</goal> #<2>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
...
```
<1> Add the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.x/maven-plugin/[Spring Boot Maven plugin] to the build using the previously defined `spring-boot.version` property.
<2> Specify that the `repackage` goal of the Spring Boot plugin should be executed during the `package` phase of the Maven build. This leads to the creation of new jar file repackaged to create a self-contained, executable application. The originally generated jar file is kept but renamed with the `.original` suffix appended to its name.
<3> Activate https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-filtering/index.html[Maven filtering] on files put in `src/main/resources` where Spring Boot configuration files live so that properties in the `${property.name}` can be interpolated and replaced during the build
<4> Also perform Maven filtering on `src/test/resources` test resource files

== Deploying the application on OpenShift

Now that we've seen the gist of the application and how to run it locally, let's look at what's needed to deploy it on OpenShift. This is accomplished using the http://maven.fabric8.io/[Fabric8 Maven Plugin] (aka FMP). FMP brings your Java applications to OpenShift. Tightly integrated with Maven, it leverages the existing build configuration to focus on two tasks: building Docker images and creating OpenShift (or plain Kubenertes) resource descriptors. Since our application is built using Maven, it makes sense to continue to leverage that tool to generate whatever is necessary to deploy and run our application on OpenShift.

NOTE: The following steps assume that you are currently connected to a running OpenShift cluster via `oc login`. By doing so, FMP will be able to determine that you are targeting an OpenShift deployment automatically and take additional steps to generate OpenShift-specific descriptors (as opposed to generic Kubernetes ones).

First, we need to tell Maven that we want to use this plugin. This is accomplished in the parent POM of our booster, which is declared as:
```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>io.openshift</groupId>
    <artifactId>booster-parent</artifactId>
    <version>23</version>
</parent>
```
NOTE: We're considering removing the need for a parent and including the FMP (Fabric8 Maven Plugin) configuration directly in our boosters.

Let's look at the parts that deal with configuring the Fabric8 Maven Plugin:
```xml
...
  <properties>
    ...
    <fabric8-maven-plugin.version>3.5.40</fabric8-maven-plugin.version> #<1>
    ...

    <fabric8.generator.from>registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift:1.2</fabric8.generator.from> #<2>
    <fabric8.openshift.trimImageInContainerSpec>true</fabric8.openshift.trimImageInContainerSpec> #<3>
    <fabric8.skip.build.pom>true</fabric8.skip.build.pom> #<4>
  </properties>

  ...

  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>

        <plugin>
          <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
          <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${fabric8-maven-plugin.version}</version> #<5>
        </plugin>

        ...
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
    ...
  </build>
...
```
<1> Specify which version of FMP to use in a property, to be used in the plugin definition later on.
<2> Specify which Docker base image to use when generating the images for our application. The base image will serve as the foundation on top of which the FMP plugin adds our application to create a container ready to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. In this case, the base image is the
https://access.redhat.com/containers/?tab=overview&platform=openshift#/registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift[Red Hat supported OpenJDK 8 image] since our application is, at its code, a Java application. The booster's parent specifies that version `1.2` should be used but this property is overridden in the booster itself to use a more recent version. We will look later at how this is done in our booster (essentially, redefining the `fabric8.generator.from` property but with a twist)!
<3> This configuration property is only needed if running on OpenShift `3.7` version earlier than `3.7.2` to work around an issue between an older version of FMP and OpenShift `3.7`. This property might be removed in future versions of the boosters. For more details on this issue, see https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/issues/1130#issuecomment-366216830 (and below).
<4> This configuration property instructs FMP to not build modules with the `pom` type. Without this property, This was required for an older version of FMP and might become needed again. For more details on this issue, see https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin/issues/1184#issuecomment-368308674 (and below).
<5> Specify that we want to use the Fabric8 Maven Plugin at the version that we previously specified.

NOTE: You can see and explore the list of Red Hat supported containers that can serve as base images for you applications at: https://access.redhat.com/containers/.

Now that we've seen the configuration of the plugin in the booster parent, let's look at how it's used in the booster itself:

```xml
...
  <properties>
    ...
    <openjdk18-openshift.version>1.3</openjdk18-openshift.version> #<2>
    <fabric8.generator.from>
      registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift:${openjdk18-openshift.version} #<3>
    </fabric8.generator.from>
  </properties>
  ...
  <profile>
    <id>openshift</id> #<1>
    <build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
          <artifactId>fabric8-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <executions>
            <execution>
              <id>fmp</id>
              <goals>
                <goal>resource</goal> #<4>
                <goal>build</goal>
              </goals>
            </execution>
          </executions>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </build>
  </profile>
...
```
<1> Since we don't want the Docker image / OpenShift resource descriptor generation process executed by FMP when we only want to run the application locally, we "hide" the FMP execution behind an `openshift` profile.
<2> Earlier, we said that we would redefine the version of the base image used to perform our builds. This is how we do it: instead of re-defining the whole `fabric8.generator.from` property, we introduce a new `openjdk18-openshift.version` property, which we set to the desired value and
<3> ... use that property when specifying the `fabric8.generator.from` property, thus allowing us to easily change the image version without touching the base image identifier.
<4> We bind the plugin https://maven.fabric8.io/#fabric8:resource[`resource`] and https://maven.fabric8.io/#fabric8:build[`build`] goals to Maven's lifecycle so that they are automatically run when we execute a Maven build. The `resource` goal creates the OpenShift resource descriptors (by default a https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[`Service`] along with an associated https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/networking/routes.html[`Route`] and a https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[`DeploymentConfig`]) while `build` creates a Docker image using the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I) build process] by default using the base image we specified above.

We then need to execute the https://maven.fabric8.io/#fabric8:deploy[`fabric8:deploy`] goal of the Fabric8 Maven plugin to deploy the application to an OpenShift cluster. Since we have bound the `resource` and `build` goals to Maven's lifecycle, they will be automatically triggered at appropriate times during the build process. Resource descriptors will therefore be appropriately generated using information from the booster's POM, a Docker image containing all that's needed to run a Java application *and* our application will be built using the S2I process and finally, all these artifacts will be pushed to the OpenShift cluster we're connected to.
